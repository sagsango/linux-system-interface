<p class="noindenta"><em>The Linux Programming Interface</em> is the definitive guide to the Linux and UNIX programming interface&#8212;the interface employed by nearly every application that runs on a LinuxorUNIX system.</p>
<p class="indent">In this authoritative work, Linux programming expert Michael Kerriskprovides detailed descriptions of the system calls and library functions that you need in order to master the craft of system programming, and accompanies his explanations with clear, complete example programs.</p>
<p class="indentb">You&#8217;ll find descriptions of over 500 system calls and library functions, and more than 200 example programs, 88 tables, and 115 diagrams. You&#8217;ll learn how to:</p>
<p class="arrow"><img src="../images/arrow.jpg" alt="image"/> Read and write files efficiently</p>
<p class="arrow"><img src="../images/arrow.jpg" alt="image"/> Use signals, clocks, and timers</p>
<p class="arrow"><img src="../images/arrow.jpg" alt="image"/> Create processes and execute programs</p>
<p class="arrow"><img src="../images/arrow.jpg" alt="image"/> Write secure programs</p>
<p class="arrow"><img src="../images/arrow.jpg" alt="image"/> Write multithreaded programs using POSIX threads</p>
<p class="arrow"><img src="../images/arrow.jpg" alt="image"/> Build and use shared libraries</p>
<p class="arrow"><img src="../images/arrow.jpg" alt="image"/> Perform interprocess communication using pipes, message queues, shared memory, and semaphores</p>
<p class="arrow"><img src="../images/arrow.jpg" alt="image"/> Write network applications with the sockets API</p>
<p class="noindentt">While <em>The Linux Programming Interface</em> covers a wealth of Linux-specific features, including epoll, inotify, and the /proc file system, its emphasis on UNIX standards (POSIX.l-2001/SUSv3 and POSIX.l-2008/SUSv4) makes it equally valuable to programmers working on other UNIX platforms.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>The Linux Programming Interface</em> is the most comprehensive single-volume work on the Linux and UNIX programming interface, and a book that&#8217;s destined to become a new classic.</p>

<div class="image1"><img src="../images/f1509-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="noindent">Michael Kerrisk (<em><a href="http://man7.org/">http://man7.org/</a></em>) has been using and programming UNIX systems for more than 20 years, and has taught many week-long courses on UNIX system programming. Since 2004, he has maintained the man-pages project, which produces the manual pages describing the Linux kernel and glibc programming APIs. He has written or cowritten more than 250 of the manual pages and is actively involved in the testing and design review of new Linux kernel-userspace interfaces. Michael lives with his family in Munich, Germany.</p>
