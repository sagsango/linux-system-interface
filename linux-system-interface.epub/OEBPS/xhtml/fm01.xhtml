<h2 class="h2a" id="fm01"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_i"/><strong>PRAISE FOR <em>THE LINUX PROGRAMMING INTERFACE</em></strong></h2>
<p class="bqf">&#8220;If I had to choose a single book to sit next to my machine when writing software for Linux, this would be it.&#8221;</p>
<p class="attf">&#8212;M<small>ARTIN</small> L<small>ANDERS</small>, S<small>OFTWARE</small> E<small>NGINEER</small>, G<small>OOGLE</small></p>
<p class="bqf">&#8220;Michael Kerrisk&#8217;s new book [is] a thing of beauty. A book you&#8217;re proud to just have on the shelf, but too useful to stay there.&#8221;</p>
<p class="attf">&#8212;S<small>ERGE</small> H<small>ALLYN</small>, L<small>INUX</small> K<small>ERNEL</small> D<small>EVELOPER</small></p>
<p class="bqf">&#8220;I found <em>The Linux Programming Interface</em> to be extremely useful and expect to return to it frequently. Anyone who has an interest in programming for Linux will likely feel the same way.&#8221;</p>
<p class="attf">&#8212;J<small>AKE</small> E<small>DGE</small>, LWN.<small>NET</small></p>
<p class="bqf">&#8220;This book, with its detailed descriptions and examples, contains everything you need to understand the details and nuances of the low-level programming APIs in Linux . . . no matter what the level of reader, there will be something to be learnt from this book.&#8221;</p>
<p class="attf">&#8212;M<small>EL</small> G<small>ORMAN</small>, <small>AUTHOR OF</small> <em>Understanding the Linux Virtual Memory Manager</em></p>
<p class="bqf">&#8220;Michael&#8217;s inexhaustible determination to get his information right, and to express it clearly and concisely, has resulted in a strong reference source for programmers. While this work is targeted at Linux programmers, it will be of value to any programmer working in the UNIX/POSIX ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
<p class="attf">&#8212;D<small>AVID</small> B<small>UTENHOF</small>, <small>AUTHOR OF</small> <em>Programming with POSIX Threads</em> <small>AND CONTRIBUTOR TO THE</small> POSIX <small>AND</small> UNIX <small>STANDARDS</small></p>
<p class="bqf">&#8220;Simply the best Linux programming book since Steven&#8217;s Unix programming books.&#8221;</p>
<p class="attf">&#8212;C<small>HRIS</small> B<small>ARBER</small>, CB1, INC.</p>
<p class="bqf"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_ii"/>&#8220;. . . encyclopedic in the breadth and depth of its coverage, and textbook-like in its wealth of worked examples and exercises. Each topic is clearly and comprehensively covered, from theory to hands-on working code. Professionals, students, educators, this is the Linux/UNIX reference that you have been waiting for.&#8221;</p>
<p class="attf">&#8212;A<small>NTHONY</small> R<small>OBINS</small>, A<small>SSOCIATE</small> P<small>ROFESSOR OF</small> C<small>OMPUTER</small> S<small>CIENCE</small>, T<small>HE</small> U<small>NIVERSITY OF</small> O<small>TAGO</small></p>
<p class="bqf">&#8220;. . . a very thorough&#8212;yet easy to read&#8212;explanation of UNIX system and network programming, with an emphasis on Linux systems. It&#8217;s certainly a book I&#8217;d recommend to anybody wanting to get into UNIX programming (in general) or to experienced UNIX programmers wanting to know what&#8217;s new in the popular GNU/Linux system.&#8221;</p>
<p class="attf">&#8212;F<small>ERNANDO</small> G<small>ONT</small>, N<small>ETWORK</small> S<small>ECURITY</small> R<small>ESEARCHER</small>, IETF <small>PARTICIPANT</small>, <small>AND</small> RFC <small>AUTHOR</small></p>
<p class="bqf">&#8220;If you think you don&#8217;t need this book since you know everything already, that&#8217;s what I thought too, and I was wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p class="attf">&#8212;B<small>ERT</small> H<small>UBERT</small>, N<small>ETHERLABS</small> C<small>OMPUTER</small> C<small>ONSULTING</small></p>
<p class="bqf">&#8220;Michael&#8217;s book is a different kind of beast . . . <em>everything</em> relating to the subject that I could reasonably think of is in the book, in a very thorough and maniacally complete yet enjoyably readable way.&#8221;</p>
<p class="attf">&#8212;F<small>EDERICO</small> L<small>UCIFREDI</small>, <small>SLASHDOT.ORG</small></p>
<p class="bqf">&#8220;. . . an essential resource for the serious or professional Linux and UNIX systems programmer. Michael Kerrisk covers the use of all the key APIs across both the Linux and UNIX system interfaces with clear descriptions and tutorial examples and stresses the importance and benefits of following standards such as the Single UNIX Specification and POSIX 1003.1.&#8221;</p>
<p class="attf">&#8212;A<small>NDREW</small> J<small>OSEY</small>, D<small>IRECTOR</small>, S<small>TANDARDS</small>, T<small>HE</small> O<small>PEN</small> G<small>ROUP</small>, <small>AND</small> C<small>HAIR OF THE</small> POSIX 1003.1 W<small>ORKING</small> G<small>ROUP</small></p>
<p class="bqf">&#8220;What could be better than an encyclopedic reference to the Linux system, from the standpoint of the system programmer, written by none other than the maintainer of the man pages himself? <em>The Linux Programming Interface</em> is comprehensive and detailed. I firmly expect it to become an indispensable addition to my programming bookshelf.&#8221;</p>
<p class="attf">&#8212;B<small>ILL</small> G<small>ALLMEISTER</small>, <small>AUTHOR OF</small> <em>POSIX.4 Programmer&#8217;s Guide: Programming for the Real World</em></p>
<p class="bqf"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_iii"/>&#8220;Kerrisk&#8217;s book is more thorough, more comprehensive and just as well written as the Stevens and Rochkind books. . . . It is now easily THE standard book on Linux/UNIX system programming.&#8221;</p>
<p class="attf">&#8212;V<small>LADIMIR</small> G. I<small>VANOVIC</small>, <small>SOFTWARE PRODUCT MANAGEMENT</small></p>
<p class="bqf">&#8220;. . . the most complete and up-to-date book about Linux and UNIX system programming. If you&#8217;re new to Linux system programming, if you&#8217;re a UNIX veteran focused on portability while interested in learning the Linux way, or if you&#8217;re simply looking for an excellent reference about the Linux programming interface, then Michael Kerrisk&#8217;s book is definitely the companion you want on your bookshelf.&#8221;</p>
<p class="attf">&#8212;L<small>O&#207;C</small> D<small>OMAIGN&#201;</small>, C<small>HIEF</small> S<small>OFTWARE</small> A<small>RCHITECT</small> (E<small>MBEDDED</small>), <small>CORPULS.COM</small></p>
<p class="bqf">&#8220;Michael Kerrisk has not only written a great book about Linux programming and how it relates to various standards, but has also taken care that bugs he noticed got fixed and the man pages were (greatly) improved. In all three ways, he has made Linux programming easier. The in-depth treatment of topics in <em>The Linux Programming Interface</em> . . . makes it a must-have reference for both new and experienced Linux programmers.&#8221;</p>
<p class="attf">&#8212;A<small>NDREAS</small> J<small>AEGER</small>, P<small>ROGRAM</small> M<small>ANAGER</small>, <small>OPEN</small>SUSE, N<small>OVELL</small></p>
<p class="bqf">&#8220;An outstanding book in the style of [the] beloved classic <em>Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment</em>. . . . The treatment of each system call is very thorough, indicating deviations from the Single UNIX Specification and comparisons with various Unix flavors.&#8221;</p>
<p class="attf">&#8212;J<small>OHN</small> W<small>IERSBA</small>, L<small>INUX</small>/UNIX <small>PROGRAMMER</small>, T<small>HOMSON</small> R<small>EUTERS</small></p>
<p class="bqf">&#8220;It&#8217;s a wonderful book . . . well written and never boring . . . the author has achieved the right balance in his descriptions and is able to explain clearly a huge variety of topics.&#8221;</p>
<p class="attf">&#8212;D<small>R</small>. J<small>OHN</small> G<small>RAHAM</small>-C<small>UMMING</small>, <small>PROGRAMMER AND AUTHOR OF</small> <em>The Geek Atlas</em></p>
<p class="bqf">&#8220;I&#8217;ve been very impressed by the precision, the quality and the level of detail Michael Kerrisk put in his book. He is a great expert of Linux system calls and lets us share his knowledge and understanding of the Linux APIs.&#8221;</p>
<p class="attf">&#8212;C<small>HRISTOPHE</small> B<small>LAESS</small>, <small>AUTHOR OF</small> <em>Programmation syst&#232;me en C sous Linux</em></p>
<p class="bqf">&#8220;[<em>The Linux Programming Interface</em>] will no doubt become the standard guide for Linux system programming.&#8221;</p>
